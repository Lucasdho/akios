description: Turn an approved spec into a lean, executable backlog of task files under tasks/todo/ in a single pass — replaces speckit's clarify/specify/plan/tasks phases for Swift/iOS work. Use after idea-to-spec has produced specs/<feature>.md and you need the execution backlog, or when a user runs /akios:plan. Produces atomic task files with est_tokens + runner, parallel markers, checkpoint barriers, definitions of done, and per-task UI-state coverage. Does NOT write app code — it writes the plan that task-execution runs.

# Spec to Tasks — one pass, spec → tasks/todo/

Turns an approved spec into the execution backlog for `task-execution`: **one task file per task
under `tasks/todo/`**. One skill, one pass, one human confirm — this replaces speckit's four
phases and its `.specify/` + constitution machinery, none of which this skill creates or needs.

**Why it exists:** `idea-to-spec` already resolves ambiguity decision-by-decision upstream, and
the kit's gates (`AGENTS.md` house rules, `swift-dev`, `/code-review`) enforce quality downstream.
This skill does the one thing that was missing: decompose the spec into runnable, sized tasks.

## Inputs / output
- **In:** one or more approved `specs/<feature>.md` (passed as `$ARGUMENTS`), plus `Context.md`
  (architecture/conventions) and `MEMORY.md` (locked decisions). Read **only** these.
- **Out:** task files in `tasks/todo/` (`T<NNN>-<slug>.md`, see the `task.md` template), and the
  spec's status set to `planned` in `Roadmap.md`. No single `tasks.md`, no `.specify/`, no constitution.

## The pass (do this in order, once)

1. **Read** the spec(s) + `Context.md` + `MEMORY.md`. Nothing else. Don't re-clarify what the spec
   already settled — if something is genuinely ambiguous, ask one direct question, no clarify ceremony.
2. **Decompose by similarity + size, on the ALVA slice.**
   - **Group by similarity** — same file / area / concern travels together, and for a new or
     touched feature, `area` follows the slice sub-folder it belongs to (`Features/<F>/domain`,
     `.../data`, `.../presentation/<View>`, `.../contract`, `.../tests`) — not an app-wide layer.
     A task never spans two features' internals; cross-feature work is a `contract/` change on
     one side and a consumer change on the other, as separate tasks.
   - **Bound by size** — estimate each task's cost and keep it under the **80k soft ceiling**; split
     a task that would exceed it. Atomic = one coherent change with one Definition of Done.
3. **Estimate cost (rough proxy).** `est_tokens ≈ Σ touched-file sizes + description weight`. For
   **new** files, estimate from the spec description (acknowledged as rough). Record `est_tokens`
   on the task and derive `runner`: **`≤20k → orchestrator`** (always runs in the main session),
   **`>20k → subagent-eligible`**. This field sizes the task — it does not mandate dispatch;
   `task-execution` still applies `AGENTS.md`'s subagent-economy rule (session context pressure
   **and** an isolatable task) before actually dispatching one.

   *Worked example:* a task editing two existing files (~3k + ~5k tokens) plus one new ~4k-token
   view, with a two-sentence description (~0.1k) → `est_tokens ≈ 12k` → `runner: orchestrator`.
   A task touching six files across a data layer + its tests (~9k) plus a new ~15k-token
   migration path, description weight ~0.5k → `est_tokens ≈ 25k` → `runner: subagent-eligible`.
4. **Graph parallelism by area.** Tag a task `[P]` (`parallel: true`) only if it shares no files
   and no produced symbols with another `[P]` task in the same checkpoint — i.e. a **different
   area**. Same-area tasks **serialize**.
5. **Checkpoints = barriers.** Group tasks into checkpoints in execution order. A checkpoint is a
   point where all its in-flight `[P]` tasks must finish before continuing; each carries an
   **audit** (verify every DoD). Mark `[major]` when it completes a vertical slice — `[major]`
   runs the unit + integration test battery before advancing.
6. **Designer's-eye (mandatory for any UI- or data-backed task).** Translate the spec's empty
   states into per-task acceptance criteria: every screen-touching task's DoD covers **happy ·
   empty · loading/in-flight · error/offline**. A UI task whose DoD omits these is incomplete.
7. **Apply the data house rules** when scoping model/persistence tasks:
   - **Native types over wrappers** — Swift's own `id`/`UUID`/`Hashable`/`Codable` first; a wrapper
     needs a one-line justification in the task.
   - **Protocol-first repositories** — `protocol` + defaults; concretes inherit. A repository task's
     DoD includes "protocol defined, defaults provided, `Hashable` + JSON↔object round-trip covered."
8. **Foundation-consult step (every task that creates a helper, protocol, or component).**
   Add a DoD line: "consulted `Foundation/Design-tokens`/`Code-tokens` before writing new shared
   code — reused if found, else born inside this feature." This is the executable form of ALVA
   P6 (`swift-dev`'s `alva-architecture` guide) — the task, not the agent's judgment, is what
   carries the reminder forward into execution.
9. **Tag each task with its `swift-dev` domain sub-skill** (routing below) — the executor's
   subagent starts cold and must load it. A task that scaffolds a new feature/slice, or touches
   `Router/`/`Container/`, is tagged `alva-architecture` first, alongside whatever code-level
   guide also applies.
10. **One interactive confirm.** Show the checkpoint/task graph + est_tokens/runner + designer's-eye
    coverage compactly. Get a yes or adjustments. *Then* write the task files into `tasks/todo/`.

## Task file format
One file per task in `tasks/todo/`, following `templates/task.md`:

```markdown
---
id: T001
spec: specs/<feature>.md
est_tokens: 14k
runner: orchestrator        # ≤20k orchestrator · >20k subagent
parallel: true              # true = [P]; shares no files/symbols with siblings this checkpoint
area: Squad/presentation/SquadList   # slice sub-folder; same-area tasks serialize
checkpoint: 1               # [major] checkpoints run the test battery
swift_dev: swiftui-pro      # domain sub-skill the cold subagent must load
---

# T001 — <one-line goal>
> **State:** todo                       # state is the folder: todo→in-progress→review→done

## Description … ## Files … ## Definition of Done … ## UI states … ## Notes
```

State is the **containing folder**; `task-execution` moves the file `todo → in-progress → review
→ done`. Checkpoint order and `[major]` markers are carried on each task's `checkpoint` field.

## swift-dev domain routing (tag every task)

| Task type | swift-dev sub-skill |
|---|---|
| New feature/slice scaffold, DI wiring, navigation/coordinators | `alva-architecture` |
| Views, SwiftUI layouts, previews | `swiftui-pro` |
| async/await, actors, Sendable, concurrency | `swift-concurrency-pro` |
| Unit tests, Swift Testing | `swift-testing-pro` |
| SwiftData, persistence, migrations | `swiftdata-pro` |
| VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, a11y | `ios-accessibility` |
| Run / build / debug behavior | `ios-debugger-agent` |
| UI polish, widgets, design | `swiftui-design-principles` |
| Figma → SwiftUI | `figma-to-swiftui` |

## Hand-off
`tasks/todo/` is the sole input to `task-execution` (`/akios:execute`). Stop after writing the
files + updating `Roadmap.md`; tell the user the backlog is ready and that `/akios:execute` ships it.

## Anti-patterns
- Creating `.specify/`, a constitution, or any second formal spec format. Don't.
- Re-clarifying a spec `idea-to-spec` already settled.
- A task without `est_tokens`/`runner`, without a DoD, or a UI task without empty/loading/error coverage.
- More than one human confirm. One review, then write.
