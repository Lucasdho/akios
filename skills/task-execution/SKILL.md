description: Drive a tasks/todo/ backlog to implemented, committed, reviewed Swift/iOS code — the kit's execution phase (absorbs the execution discipline once borrowed from superpowers). Use after spec-to-tasks has produced task files, or when a user runs /akios:execute. Works on a per-spec branch, moves task files through folder states, writes tests first, commits at each checkpoint, manages the context window, archives finished specs, and stops at a hard human gate before any push or merge.

# Task Execution — tasks/todo/ → shipped, reviewed code

Runs the backlog `spec-to-tasks` produced. This is the kit's Phase 3 — it owns the execution loop
end to end with **no external skill dependency** (the TDD and verification discipline once borrowed
from `superpowers` is built in here). Subagents are a **tool, not the spine** — execution never
*depends* on them, because this environment can deny them `xcodebuild`.

**Input:** the task files in `tasks/todo/`. **Output:** the feature implemented and committed on a
branch — **not pushed, not merged.**

## Setup (once, before any task)
1. **Branch per spec.** Create `feature/<spec>`. Never work on `main`/`master`.
2. **Keep specs + tasks on the working branch.** Work in-place. If you use a worktree, commit
   `specs/` + `tasks/` onto the branch first — otherwise the executor can't edit them and the task
   states never update.
3. **Detect the build path.** Try a no-op `xcodebuild`/builder dispatch once. If subagents are
   denied it (common in background sessions), set a flag: run all builds/tests **in this session**.
   Never let a dead subagent stall execution — degrade to inline.

## Multi-instance: claim before you work (team mode)
When `Roadmap.md` has `collaboration: team`, several teammates' akios instances share this repo. Claim
a unit before touching it so two instances never build the same thing. **Solo mode skips all of this.**

- **Identity.** Each instance has a signature from `.claude/hooks/akios-instance.sh` (or the plugin's
  `scripts/akios-instance.sh`) — `user@host/id`, e.g. `lucas@mbp/3f2a9c`. It rides on commit trailers
  (`Akios-Instance:`) and claim records so a teammate's akios can recognize who did what.
- **Claim protocol (git is the lock, no server):**
  1. `git pull` (or fetch) first.
  2. Check the unit isn't already owned: a task's frontmatter `owner:`, or the owner annotation on its
     `Roadmap.md` spec line (for a spec/unit with no tasks yet). If owned by **another** signature →
     **yield**, pick the next unit. (Claims live in **committed** files, never in gitignored `.akios/`,
     so a `git pull` shows you what teammates hold.)
  3. Claim: set the task frontmatter `owner: <sig>` + `claimed_at` (or annotate the unit's `Roadmap.md`
     line `owner: <sig>` when no tasks exist yet), move `todo → in-progress`, commit
     `claim: <task> by <sig>`, **push immediately**.
  4. **Push rejected** = someone pushed first → pull, re-check ownership, yield if it was taken.
     The push race *is* the arbitration; don't add a lock server.
- **Stale claims.** A claim that's old with no commits behind it may be reclaimed — note the takeover
  in the commit so the original owner sees it.
- **Roadmap.md is shared.** It stays the single source of truth, but edit **only your unit's line** in
  the `## Specs` table — never reorder it. Status is **monotonic** (`designed < planned < in-progress
  < done`, plus the `needs-revision`/`blocked` demotion side-states — full order in `Roadmap.md`'s
  status-enum note); on a merge conflict, **higher status wins** (a finished spec is never demoted by
  a stale edit). This rule lets an unattended run resolve the merge without a human.

## The task lifecycle (state = folder)
Each task file lives in a folder that **is** its state. Process tasks checkpoint by checkpoint,
in order; within a checkpoint respect `[P]`/area (different-area `[P]` tasks may run in parallel
when subagents are available and cheap; otherwise sequentially in-session — same result).

```
for each task (by checkpoint, respecting [P]/area):
  move  tasks/todo/<T>.md → tasks/in-progress/
  consult the PRIORITY CHAIN (below) before choosing any pattern
  load the task's pack reference by scope, per its `pack:<domain>` tag (default `pack:ios` for a
    Swift repo — its realization is swift-dev's bundled domain sub-skill; a non-ios pack's
    realization is its own INDEX.md-selected reference)
  [Foundation gate] before writing any new helper/protocol/component → consult ONLY
    Foundation/ (never the whole repo); see "Foundation ledger" below
  [UI gate] if task is UI-scoped → run align-ui (auto-decide mode under just-vibes; grilling skipped, gate itself is not)
  TDD  → failing test → implement → green        (see TDD posture)
  move  → tasks/review/
  /verify (when runnable) + /code-review
  move  → tasks/done/        (only when the DoD is actually met; failure loops to in-progress)
↳ at each checkpoint barrier: audit EVERY task's DoD + the boundary lint, then commit "checkpoint: <name>"
```

- **UI alignment gate.** A task is UI-scoped when its title or scope mentions View, Screen,
  SwiftUI, layout, or UI. Before writing any implementation code, run the `align-ui` skill:
  it resolves every visual and interaction decision with the user and writes
  `tasks/ui-alignment/<ScreenName>.md`. Load that file as the highest-priority reference for
  the task — it overrides `swift-dev` and `code-references/` for visual decisions.
  Under just-vibes the **interactive grilling** is skipped — `align-ui` still runs, in auto-decide
  mode, and writes the alignment doc unattended (every auto-decision marked `[auto]`).

- **Make-it-live is one pass, not two.** The third A3 stage (after components and the
  `ui-variations`-graduated dumb screen already exist at `presentation/<View>/<View>View.swift`)
  attaches the real ViewModel via `init` **and** pulls real data just-in-time in the **same
  pass** — there is no separate translation/grounding step, because the graduated screen is
  already the target SwiftUI code. `align-ui`'s post-wiring check runs right after: does the
  real-data render still hold up against the mock-data-approved graduate (same-engine, same-code
  — not a cross-engine diff against a retired `visual-grounding` reference).

- **Runner routing + model tier.** Read the task's `runner`: `≤20k → orchestrator` (always run inline);
  `>20k → subagent-eligible` — **eligibility, not a mandate**: dispatch only when `AGENTS.md`'s
  subagent-economy rule also says yes (driving session **≥120k tokens** *and* the task is heavy and
  isolatable). Below that bar, run a `subagent`-tagged task inline too — the field sizes the task, it
  doesn't override the session-pressure judgment call. When you do dispatch, pick the **cheapest model
  that fits**: a
  simple, well-scoped task (mechanical edit, a focused search, one test file, a refactor with a clear
  precedent) → **haiku**; a task that implements real behavior end-to-end (judgment + TDD across files)
  → **sonnet**. Never dispatch a model more capable than the subtask needs. (The driving session itself
  runs on **opus or sonnet** — sonnet is the budget default; choose per budget.) If the subagent layer
  is unavailable, **degrade to inline** — never fail.
- **Cold-subagent discipline (only when you dispatch one).** A subagent starts cold. Its prompt MUST
  carry — and *only* — the slice it needs: the task + its DoD, the task's named **`swift-dev` domain
  sub-skill**, `ponytail` (if installed), and any `Context.md` gotcha matching the task type. Restate
  gates — it inherits nothing. **Never clone your context window into it:** a subagent is billed for
  every token you hand it, so pasting the whole conversation is the most expensive mistake here — send
  the slice, not the session.

## Foundation ledger (ALVA — read, never count)
Before creating any new helper, protocol, or shared component, consult **only**
`Foundation/Design-tokens/` and `Foundation/Code-tokens/` — a small, bounded search — never the
whole repo (`swift-dev`'s `alva-architecture` guide, doctrine P6). If nothing there fits, the code
is born inside the current feature; it is not shared preemptively.

- **You read `Foundation/usage-ledger.json`; you never count.** The count is produced by a
  deterministic tool (`scripts/alva-usage-ledger.sh` or its consumer-repo git-hook installation) —
  investigating usage across features is not something you do by grepping the repo per-run.
- **Each ledger entry becomes a task, not a silent move.** Every `candidates_promote` /
  `candidates_demote` entry in the ledger gets written as a new `tasks/todo/T<NNN>-*.md` (promote:
  move the symbol to its `target` behind a contract if it's a Code-token; demote: return it to its
  sole remaining feature). Promotion is **suggested**, reviewed like any other task — never mutate
  `Foundation/` because the ledger said so without a task and a DoD.
- **Boundary lint runs at the checkpoint barrier.** A feature importing another feature's
  `domain/`/`data/` internals (instead of its `contract/`) fails the barrier audit — fix the import
  or extend the contract before the checkpoint commits. This is the lint realization of doctrine
  P3 (folder-first + lint by default; compiler-enforced local SPM modules only once the app has
  earned it — a recurring violation, or the user asks).

## The priority chain (consult before any code decision)
First tier with a relevant answer wins; lower tiers only fill silence:

```
1. Project decision (MEMORY.md + existing code / Context.md)
2. Knowledge packs, user-curated (code-references/ = the project's auto-built code pack — load
   the file whose INDEX tag matches the task domain; other ingested packs route the same way
   by pack:<domain>)
3. User preferences (~/.claude/akios/preferences.md)
4. Baseline packs, shipped floor (swift-dev = the ios pack)
```

Concrete shown code outranks a stated preference. A repo's established architecture is not
rewritten because of a general preference.

## TDD posture (tests-first where meaningful)
- **Logic / data / concurrency** → write the failing test first (Swift Testing /
  `swift-dev:swift-testing-pro`), then implement to green, then refactor.
- **Pure SwiftUI views** → no useful unit test of layout exists; the bar is a working **Preview**
  + the **happy / empty / loading / error** states the task's DoD lists + a snapshot test **if** the
  project has the harness. Don't force brittle view tests.

## Barrier = audit + commit
At each `↳ barrier`: verify **every** task's DoD is met (not "code exists" — DoD met), **and** run
the boundary lint (no slice importing another slice's internals instead of its `contract/`). Then
`git commit -m "checkpoint: <name>"`. A failing DoD or a boundary violation blocks the commit; fix
or split, don't paper over it. At a `[major]` checkpoint, run the unit + integration battery first —
a red battery blocks the next checkpoint.

## Feedback logging (preferences)
While executing, watch for preference signals — an explicit statement ("prefiro X") or a repeated
correction (the 2nd time the user undoes the same kind of change). At a natural pause, **propose**
appending it to `~/.claude/akios/preferences.md` (dedup, append-only). Never write silently.

## Context management — MANDATORY compact between specs

**Hard rule: run `/compact` after every spec completes, before starting the next one.**
This is not advisory. A spec boundary is the only safe compression point — mid-spec compaction
drops live execution context (task state, DoD progress, checkpoint position) and forces costly
re-derivation.

```
spec N ships → archive → /compact ← MANDATORY → spec N+1 starts
```

Monitor the window and act before it forces you:
- **110k tokens:** warn the user, finish the current task cleanly before the next.
- **135k tokens:** urgent — complete the current checkpoint, then `/compact` immediately,
  even if mid-spec. A forced compaction mid-spec is the failure; reaching 135k without
  warning is the error to fix.

Never start a new spec without compacting first, regardless of token count.

## Archive on spec completion
When a spec's last checkpoint is green and all its tasks are `done`:
1. Append a **summary block** to `archive/Archive.md` — decisions, files touched, outcome.
2. Move the full spec to `archive/<spec>.md`.
3. Clear that spec's `tasks/done/` files (captured in the summary + git).
4. Record the **durable decisions** into native `MEMORY.md` (the spec-level what/where stays in
   `Archive.md`; recall-worthy decisions go to `MEMORY.md` — no duplication).

Future sessions read `archive/Archive.md` first and open a full archived file only on demand.

## Finish — the hard human gate
When the last checkpoint is green:
- Commits exist on `feature/<spec>`. **Nothing is pushed. Nothing is merged.**
- Run `/verify` and `/code-review`; report failures honestly with output — don't claim done on a red.
- **Then ask the user two things and wait:** (a) push this branch? (b) merge — and *where*
  (`dev` / `main` / other)? Never assume the target. Act only on their answer.

**Exception — running under `/akios:just-vibes`.** The human push/merge gate is **waived** there: the
just-vibes invocation *is* the authorization (see the `just-vibes` skill). The **quality gate is not
waived** — `/verify` + `/code-review` still run, with a bounded **fix loop** on red (diagnose + fix,
re-verify; stop after two consecutive cycles make no progress, then **park** the spec — keep the
branch + logs, mark it `blocked` in `Roadmap.md`, never deliver red). Delivery target follows
`Roadmap.md` `collaboration`: **solo** → merge `feature/<spec>` into the default branch + push it;
**team** → push `feature/<spec>` + open a PR (`gh`). Commits carry the `Akios-Instance:` trailer.

## Anti-patterns
- Starting a new spec without running `/compact` first — no exceptions.
- Implementing a UI task without running `align-ui` first — interactively, or in auto-decide mode
  under just-vibes; the gate itself never skips, only the grilling does.
- Pushing or merging without the explicit human gate — **except** under `/akios:just-vibes`, which is
  itself the authorization. Outside just-vibes, never.
- Delivering a red spec under just-vibes because the fix loop "gave up" — park it (branch + logs), never ship it.
- Working a task whose `owner:` is **another** instance's signature (team mode) — yield and pick another.
- Reordering or demoting the `Roadmap.md` `## Specs` table — edit only your line; status only moves up.
- Making execution depend on subagents (they can be denied `xcodebuild`) — always degrade to inline.
- Counting Foundation usage yourself (grepping the repo to judge "is this used elsewhere") instead
  of reading `Foundation/usage-ledger.json` — that's the exact per-run investigation cost the
  ledger exists to remove.
- Moving a symbol into `Foundation/` because the ledger flagged it, without writing a task first —
  promotion is suggested, not automatic.
- A slice importing another slice's `domain/`/`data/` instead of its `contract/` — boundary
  violation, blocks the checkpoint.
- Committing a checkpoint whose DoDs aren't actually met.
- Compressing context mid-spec.
- Writing to `preferences.md` silently, or recording project-specific facts there (those go to `MEMORY.md`).
- Mirroring spec state outside `Roadmap.md` (e.g. duplicating the `## Specs` table into `CLAUDE.md`) — one source, no duplicates.
- Cloning your full context into a subagent, or dispatching a model more capable than the subtask needs.
- Working on `main`/`master`.
