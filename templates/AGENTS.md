# AGENTS.md — Agentic Operating Manual

Loaded every session via the project `CLAUDE.md`, which imports `@AGENTS.md`
(Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md, not this file directly; Codex and other agents read
AGENTS.md directly). This is the single source of truth for how to work here —
the skill gates live below, not in a separate file.

## The loop (every code task)
1. **Orient** → `Context.md` — stack, commands, architecture, conventions
   (auto-loaded for you via the `@Context.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`).
2. **Recall** → your native auto-memory (`MEMORY.md`, loaded automatically) for
   decisions already made. Don't relitigate them.
3. **Route** → the gate table below — which skill fits this task type.
4. **Work** → the smallest change that is correct.
5. **Record** → save durable decisions to auto-memory (Claude writes it itself;
   tell it "remember that …" for anything that should survive the session).

## Always on (Swift / iOS)
Big router skills, active every task — they redirect to the right internal guides:
- `superpowers` — process discipline (brainstorm, debug, TDD, verify).
- `axiom` — Swift/iOS domain skills with progressive closure; load the hub for your
  domain and it dispatches the right sub-skill: `axiom-swiftui` (views/layout) ·
  `axiom-concurrency` (async/await/actors) · `axiom-testing` (Swift Testing/XCTest) ·
  `axiom-swift` (language) · `axiom-data` (SwiftData/CoreData) · `axiom-build` (build/debug).

**Optional (recommended):** `ponytail` — efficiency: no over-building, no rewriting
what already works. The kit works without it; install it for the laziness overlay.

## How to execute (orchestration)
For *how* the work runs — not what to build — consult **`superpowers` first**.
It owns the execution playbook: context optimization, when and how to spawn
subagents, parallelizing fan-out work, writing and executing plans, and
subagent-driven development. Reach for it before improvising an approach to:
- splitting a task across parallel agents → `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`
- driving a multi-step build through subagents → `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`
- turning a plan into reviewed execution → `superpowers:writing-plans` / `executing-plans`

Note: a spawned subagent starts cold — it does NOT inherit these gates. When you
dispatch one for gated work, restate the relevant gate in its prompt.

## Skill gates
The SessionStart hook re-states these every session, but it only reminds — it
does not enforce. Treat them as the default workflow; skip one only with reason.

| Trigger | Skill | When |
|---|---|---|
| Building a new feature end-to-end | `ios-feature-pipeline` → idea→spec→speckit→execute | before starting |
| Designing a system / turning an idea into a spec | `idea-to-spec` → write specs to `specs/` (see below) | before building |
| About to generate ANY code | plan mode OR `superpowers:brainstorming` | before code |
| About to hand-write complex code, docs, types, or a format conversion | `oss-first` — is there a mature tool/lib first? | before generating |
| Bug, crash, flake, regression | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` + `axiom-build` | before any fix |
| Implementing code | `axiom` (domain skill) + `fewer-permission-prompts` (+ `ponytail` if installed) | while coding |
| Creating / polishing SwiftUI Views | native first + `axiom-swiftui` (`ponytail` if installed) | before the view |
| Writing tests | `axiom-testing` | with the code |
| Claiming "done" | subagents: `superpowers:verification-before-completion` + `/code-review` | before finishing |

Axiom domain hubs use progressive closure — each hub (~400 words) dispatches to
sub-skills on demand. Only the relevant domain loads; context is not blown during
long plan and execution sessions.

## Where things live (artifact map)
One lookup for where every artifact is created and stored — so files land consistently and
the agent (or a newcomer) finds them fast. These are the kit's fixed conventions; your own
source dirs are described in `Context.md` `## Architecture`.

| Artifact | Location | Naming | Found / loaded via |
|---|---|---|---|
| Operating files | repo root | `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `Context.md` | Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md`, which imports the other two |
| Specs | `specs/` | `<domain>.md`, one file per domain | the `## Specs` table in `CLAUDE.md` (see below) |
| Durable decisions | native auto-memory (not in repo) | `MEMORY.md` | written automatically; survives compaction |
| Path rules | `.claude/rules/` | `<topic>.md` (e.g. `swift.md`) | fires when a matching file is read |
| Hooks | `.claude/hooks/` | `<event>-<name>.sh` | wired in `.claude/settings.json` |
| Project skills | `.claude/skills/` | `<kebab-name>/SKILL.md` | auto-discovered by description |
| Subagents | `.claude/agents/` | `<kebab-name>.md` | auto-discovered (if you add any) |
| Speckit artifacts | `.specify/` | speckit-managed (`memory/constitution.md`, …) | speckit commands |
| Task backlog | repo root or `.specify/` | `tasks.md` (from `/speckit-tasks`) | input to subagent-driven execution |
| App source | per `Context.md` `## Architecture` | project-specific | `Context.md` |

Adding a new artifact? Put it where the table says and name it the same way. If it's a spec,
add a row to the `## Specs` table so the next session knows it exists.

## Specs (idea-to-spec)
When `idea-to-spec` produces specs:
- Store versioned specs in a `specs/` folder at the repo root — one file per domain.
- Keep an **orchestration doc** that registers every spec and the domain it owns,
  so specs don't overlap and the next session knows what already exists. Use the
  project `CLAUDE.md` for this (a `## Specs` section: spec file → domain → status),
  or `specs/INDEX.md` if you prefer to keep it out of `CLAUDE.md`.
- Before designing something new, read that orchestration doc first.

## Full feature workflow (the spine)
The end-to-end idea→ship spine is owned by **`ios-feature-pipeline`** — invoke it for any
feature built from scratch. The spine at a glance:

`idea-to-spec → speckit (clarify→specify→plan→tasks) → subagent-driven-development → verify + /code-review`

When speckit is initialized (`.specify/` present) it runs the structured phases then executes
via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (every subagent context block includes the relevant
Axiom domain skill — subagents start cold). See the `ios-feature-pipeline` skill for the full
phase guide, the artifact handoffs, and the no-speckit degraded path. Don't re-document the phases
here — that skill is the single source of truth.

## Project-specific gates
{{e.g. "always /security-review when touching Keychain / auth / networking"}}

## House rules
- Shortest working diff. No speculative abstractions, no scaffolding "for later".
- One runnable check behind any non-trivial logic.
- Boring over clever. Deletion over addition.
- {{PROJECT_RULE — e.g. "never touch /migrations without a backup plan"}}
